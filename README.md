# Graham's React Playground

## Technologies Used:

 - [Axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios): uses HTTP methods to communicate with database - much lighter weight than jQuery when we just need HTTP methods.
 - [Express](http://expressjs.com/): provides a framework to set up our Node.js server.
 - [Body Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser): parses the incoming requests bodies for the info we are sending.
 - [Foreman](https://www.npmjs.com/package/foreman): allows us to boot up our API and webpack-dev-server simultaneously.
 - [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon): restarts server when files are saved with changes.
 - [Marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked): converts markdown syntax to html.
 - [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/): abstracts away the MongoDB boilerplate for a simple Schema solution.

 ## Experiments

  - I'll be using module inline styles (i.e. `import style from ‘./style’;` and `style={style.uniqueName}`), so we'll see how that goes.
